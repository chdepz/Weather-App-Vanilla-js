 # Simple Real-Time Weather Dashboard

Welcome to the Real-Time Weather Dashboard repository! This project is a simple yet effective weather application that allows you to check the current weather conditions for any city. Here's an overview of its key features and components:

## Key Features:

* User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive interface makes it easy for users to input their desired city and view real-time weather data.

* Real-Time Updates: The application leverages an external weather API to provide up-to-the-minute weather information, including temperature, cloud cover percentage, "feels like" temperature, humidity, and more.

* Default City Display: Upon loading, the application displays weather details for a default city ("Bharatpur, Nepal") while promptly updating the city name.

* Date and Time: The dashboard also keeps you informed about the current date and time, ensuring you stay up to date with the latest weather conditions.

## Code Highlights:

* JavaScript: The code is written in JavaScript and utilizes modern web technologies to fetch and display weather data.

* Asynchronous Fetching: We use asynchronous fetching to retrieve weather data from the 'weather-by-api-ninjas' API.

* Dynamic Updates: The dashboard dynamically updates temperature, cloud cover, humidity, and other weather parameters, providing an immersive user experience.

* Responsive Design: The layout is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and devices for a seamless user experience.
